# AdStake

AdStake is a Web3 platform that enables users to buy and sell NFTs containing advertisement details. It leverages blockchain technology to facilitate transparent and decentralized transactions, allowing advertisers to tokenize ad placements as NFTs. These NFTs can represent various forms of ad space, such as digital banners, social media promotions, or video placements. By utilizing the AdStake marketplace, advertisers can easily purchase ad slots while content creators and platform owners can monetize their available spaces by selling or leasing them as NFTs. This decentralized approach provides more control, transparency, and flexibility for all parties involved in digital advertising. It uses Aptos (Move), a blockchain platform known for its scalable and secure infrastructure, to power its smart contracts and manage NFT transactions efficiently.
